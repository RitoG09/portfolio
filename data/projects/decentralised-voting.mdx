# DecentraVote: Decentralized Voting Platform

## Overview

DecentraVote is a **blockchain-based voting application** designed to ensure **transparency, immutability, and trust** in digital elections. The platform leverages **Ethereum smart contracts** for vote storage and counting, while integrating **face authentication** as an additional security layer to verify voter identity.

By combining **Web3 decentralization** with **ML-based authentication**, DecentraVote explores how modern elections can be made more secure and tamper-proof.

## What Users Can Do

- **Connect Wallets:** Authenticate using MetaMask.
- **Register Candidates:** Add candidates directly on-chain.
- **Cast Votes:** Vote securely using smart contract transactions.
- **View Results in Real Time:** See live vote counts fetched from the blockchain.
- **Face Authentication:** Verify voter identity before voting.
- **Transparent Voting:** All votes are publicly verifiable on-chain.
- **Responsive Web3 UI:** Fully functional across devices.

## Why I Built This

Traditional digital voting systems suffer from:

- Centralized data storage
- Lack of transparency
- Possibility of tampering
- Weak identity verification

I built DecentraVote to explore how **blockchain’s immutability** combined with **biometric authentication** can improve trust in digital voting systems.

This project helped me understand how **Web2 identity systems** can coexist with **Web3 decentralized infrastructure**.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Next.js + React** – Web3 UI
- **TypeScript** – Type-safe dApp logic
- **Ethers.js** – Smart contract interaction
- **MetaMask** – Wallet authentication
- **Responsive UI** – Mobile-first design

### Blockchain

- **Solidity** – Smart contract development
- **Hardhat** – Contract testing & deployment
- **Ethereum** – Decentralized network
- **Smart Contracts** – Voting & candidate logic

### Machine Learning

- **Face Authentication** – Identity verification layer
- **ML Models** – Prevents unauthorized voting
- **Hybrid Auth Flow** – ML verification + wallet confirmation

## Key Technical Highlights

- Immutable voting records on blockchain
- Wallet-based voter authentication
- Smart contract–driven candidate registration
- Real-time vote tallying via on-chain reads
- ML-powered face authentication
- Secure prevention of double voting
- End-to-end decentralized architecture

## After Completion & Impact

- Built a **fully functional decentralized voting dApp**
- Gained hands-on experience with **Solidity & Ethereum**
- Learned how to deploy and interact with smart contracts
- Explored **hybrid Web2 + Web3 authentication systems**
- Strengthened understanding of **trustless system design**

## Future Plans

- Integrate zero-knowledge proofs for anonymous voting
- Deploy to public Ethereum testnets/mainnet
- Add DAO-style governance features
- Improve biometric verification accuracy
- Support multi-election management
