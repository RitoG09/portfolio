# Trad-Bot: Visual Workflow Automation SaaS

## Overview

Trad-Bot is a **production-ready workflow automation platform** that allows users to visually design, automate, and execute workflows using triggers, AI agents, messaging platforms, and external APIs.

Inspired by tools like Zapier and n8n, Trad-Bot focuses on **developer-friendly automation**, **AI-powered nodes**, and **type-safe execution** — all wrapped in a modern SaaS experience.

## What Users Can Do

- **Build Visual Workflows:** Design workflows using a drag-and-drop canvas powered by React Flow.
- **Configure Trigger Nodes:** Start workflows via Webhooks, Google Forms, Stripe events, or manual triggers.
- **Use AI Agents:** Integrate OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini for intelligent automation.
- **Send Messages:** Dispatch messages to Discord and Slack directly from workflows.
- **Make HTTP Requests:** Call external APIs using customizable HTTP nodes.
- **Run Background Jobs:** Execute long-running or async workflows reliably using Inngest.
- **Manage Subscriptions:** Handle billing and plans with Polar payments.
- **Secure Authentication:** User auth handled via Better Auth.
- **Monitor Errors:** Track runtime errors with Sentry + AI-assisted debugging.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to build something that **pushes beyond CRUD apps** and forces me to think like a **systems engineer**.

Trad-Bot exists to solve problems like:

- How do you **orchestrate workflows reliably**?
- How do you **execute background jobs without blocking requests**?
- How do you **maintain type safety across frontend, backend, and jobs**?
- How do you build a **real SaaS**, not just a demo?

This project is my deep dive into **event-driven systems, automation engines, and scalable SaaS architecture**.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15 (App Router)** – Full-stack framework
- **TypeScript** – End-to-end type safety
- **React Flow** – Visual workflow canvas
- **Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI** – Modern UI system
- **tRPC** – Fully type-safe APIs
- **Prisma ORM** – Database access layer
- **Neon Postgres** – Serverless Postgres database
- **Inngest** – Background job orchestration
- **Better Auth** – Authentication system
- **Polar** – Payments & subscriptions
- **OpenAI / Claude / Gemini** – AI workflow nodes
- **Sentry** – Error tracking & AI monitoring

## Key Technical Highlights

- Visual DAG-based workflow engine
- Event-driven execution model
- Background job processing via Inngest
- Strong isolation between workflow definition and execution
- End-to-end type safety using TypeScript + tRPC
- Production-grade error monitoring and alerting

## Current Status

Trad-Bot is **actively under development** and already structured as a **real SaaS product**, including:

- Auth
- Billing
- Background jobs
- Error tracking
- AI integrations

The focus is now on **stability, scalability, and UX polish**.

## Future Plans

- Add more trigger sources (GitHub, Cron, Email)
- Introduce workflow versioning
- Add execution logs & visual debugger
- Team collaboration & shared workflows
- Marketplace for community-built nodes
