# Swasthya: AI-Driven Wellness Monitoring Platform

## Overview

Swasthya is an **AI-driven health monitoring platform** designed to detect early signs of **fatigue, stress, and burnout** using **non-invasive ambient sensing and voice analytics**.

Unlike traditional health systems that rely on wearables or intrusive sensors, Swasthya uses **environmental signals, short voice interactions, and edge AI** to generate a real-time **Wellness Index (0–100)** — all while keeping user data private and locally processed.

## What Users Can Do

- **View Real-Time Wellness Index:** Instantly understand fatigue and stress levels.
- **Monitor Sensor Data:** Track heart rate, temperature, ambient light, and sound levels.
- **AI Breathing Exercises:** Receive personalized breathing routines based on wellness score.
- **Hydration Tracking:** Monitor daily water intake with smart email reminders.
- **AI Wellness Companion:** Talk to an AI friend over phone calls for emotional support.
- **Stress Detection:** Analyze voice tone and facial expressions for mood and fatigue.
- **Therapy Scheduling:** Discover nearby mental health clinics and book appointments.

## Why We Built This

Early fatigue and stress are often **ignored until they turn serious**, especially in:

- Workplaces
- Classrooms
- Rural or resource-constrained healthcare settings

Wearables aren’t always practical, affordable, or comfortable.

Swasthya was built to explore how **AI + ambient sensing** can act as a **silent health companion**, providing early warnings **without invading privacy or requiring constant user effort**.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React + TypeScript** – Interactive dashboard
- **Tailwind CSS** – Clean, accessible UI
- **Recharts** – Sensor data visualization
- **Google Maps API** – Therapy clinic discovery
- **Clerk** – Authentication

### Backend

- **Node.js + Express** – API layer
- **Prisma ORM** – Database access
- **PostgreSQL** – Persistent storage
- **Nodemailer** – Email reminders

### ML & AI

- **Python ML Backend** – Sensor & AI processing
- **Lightweight AI Models** – Voice & mood analysis
- **Google Gemini AI** – Personalized breathing exercises
- **Vapi.ai** – AI-powered phone calls
- **Edge AI** – Local inference without cloud dependency

### Hardware

- Heart Rate Sensor
- Body Temperature Sensor
- Ambient Light Sensor
- Sound Sensor  
  (All connected via WiFi)

## Key Technical Highlights

- Non-invasive health monitoring system
- Edge AI inference for privacy-first processing
- Multi-modal data fusion (sensor + voice + environment)
- Wellness Index generation (0–100 scale)
- Real-time dashboard with historical trends
- Hardware → Python → Node.js → React data pipeline

## After Completion & Impact

- Built a **working end-to-end prototype** integrating hardware, AI, and frontend
- Demonstrated **edge AI feasibility** for healthcare use cases
- Designed a **privacy-first health monitoring architecture**
- Showcased at a **Global Hackathon**
- Received strong feedback for innovation and real-world applicability

## Future Plans

- Improve fatigue detection accuracy with more signals
- Add long-term wellness trend analytics
- Deploy to low-resource healthcare environments
- Expand language and accessibility support
- Explore mobile-first edge deployment
