# Planova: AI-Powered Trip Planner

## Overview

Planova is an **AI-powered travel planning platform** that helps users create personalized travel itineraries in seconds. By combining structured user inputs with AI intelligence, Planova generates detailed, realistic, and budget-aware travel plans.

Instead of browsing multiple websites for hotels, attractions, and routes, users get a **single, cohesive itinerary** tailored to their needs.

## What Users Can Do

- **Create Trips:** Enter destination, trip duration, number of travelers, and budget.
- **Get AI-Generated Itineraries:** Receive day-wise travel plans instantly.
- **Budget Customization:** Choose between low, medium, and high budget options.
- **Hotel Recommendations:** View suggested accommodations based on preferences.
- **Discover Places:** Explore attractions using Google Places and Photos.
- **Download Itineraries:** Export complete trip plans as a PDF.
- **Customize Plans:** Modify trips to better suit personal preferences.

## Why I Built This

Planning a trip usually involves:

- Switching between multiple travel websites
- Manually comparing hotels, routes, and attractions
- Creating notes or documents to organize plans

I built Planova to **compress this entire workflow into a single AI-driven experience**, making travel planning faster, simpler, and more enjoyable.

This project helped me understand how **AI can be used as a decision-support tool**, not just a text generator.

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript** – Full-stack framework
- **React** – Interactive UI
- **Tailwind CSS** – Clean, accessible design
- **Gemini API** – AI itinerary generation
- **Google Places API** – Location discovery
- **Google Photos API** – Visual previews
- **MongoDB** – Data persistence
- **PDF Generation** – Downloadable itineraries
- **Render** – Deployment and hosting

## Key Technical Highlights

- Prompt-engineered AI workflows for structured itineraries
- Dynamic form-driven user inputs
- Multi-API orchestration (AI + Google APIs)
- Server-side PDF generation
- Optimized UX for non-technical users
- Scalable and extensible architecture

## After Launch & Impact

- Successfully completed and showcased at **IdeaGEM 1.0**
- Built a real-world AI product with immediate user value
- Strengthened understanding of **AI APIs without ML training**
- Improved product design and UX thinking
- Received positive feedback for simplicity and usefulness

## Future Plans

- Add user accounts and saved trips
- Support multi-city itineraries
- Add collaborative trip planning
