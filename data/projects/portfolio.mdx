# Developer Portfolio Website

## Overview

This portfolio is a **production-grade personal website** designed to showcase my projects, technical skills, and engineering mindset in a clean, fast, and accessible way.

Rather than being a static resume, the site is built as a **real product** — with proper architecture, performance optimizations, SEO, analytics, and monitoring — reflecting how I approach software in professional environments.

## What Visitors Can Do

- **Explore Projects:** Detailed case studies with tech stack, challenges, and learnings.
- **View Skills & Experience:** Clear overview of tools, frameworks, and engineering focus.
- **Book a Call:** Integrated Cal.com scheduling for direct conversations.
- **Smooth Navigation:** Fast page transitions and subtle animations.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for all screen sizes and devices.
- **SEO-Friendly Pages:** Structured metadata for discoverability.

## Why I Built This

Most developer portfolios focus only on **visuals** or **content**, but rarely both.

I built this portfolio to:

- Treat my personal brand like a **real product**
- Demonstrate **frontend, backend, and system design thinking**
- Showcase **real-world engineering decisions**, not just screenshots
- Have full control over performance, UX, and deployment

This site is also a **living project** that evolves as I grow as a developer.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15 (App Router)** – Modern full-stack framework
- **TypeScript** – Strong type safety across the app
- **React** – Component-driven UI
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling
- **Shadcn UI** – Accessible component system
- **Framer Motion** – Smooth animations & transitions
- **MDX** – Content-driven project pages
- **Contentlayer / Velite** – Typed content pipelines
- **Vercel** – Production hosting & CI/CD
- **Cal.com** – Scheduling integration
- **Sentry** – Error monitoring & observability

## Key Technical Highlights

- MDX-powered project and content system
- Optimized image and font loading
- Route-based code splitting
- Accessibility-first components
- Production monitoring with Sentry
- SEO optimization using Next.js metadata API

## Current Status

The portfolio is **actively under development**, with continuous improvements to:

- Content structure
- Performance and Lighthouse scores
- Visual polish and micro-interactions
- Accessibility and semantic HTML

## Future Plans

- Add blog and long-form technical writing
- Open-source selected components
- Improve analytics and visitor insights
- Enhance recruiter-focused content flows
